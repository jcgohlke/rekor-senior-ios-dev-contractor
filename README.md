Our customers include federal agencies, states, and local municipalities and we provide services in various verticals including parking, traffic analysis, and license plate identification.

#### About You

- Has vast experience in iOS development (proficient in Objective-C, Swift, and integrating C code into iOS apps is a plus)

- Is comfortable with a mixed-language codebase (Obj-C, C, and Swift). Isn't afraid to dig into lower level frameworks when necessary
- Is familiar with SwiftUI and Combine, and has some experience with their current limitations

#### What you'll work on

- Pulling the live video stream from the camera into our iOS app and extracting frames for analysis with our ML-driven license plate recognition engine
